# Swap-deployment-slots-in-Azure-App-Service
This project, I deploy a static HTML Mini Game website to Azure App Service, create a staging deployment slot, make changes to the code and deploy them to the staging slot, and then swap the staging and production slots to promote the changes to production. I learn how to use deployment slots for safe application updates and blue-green deployments.
